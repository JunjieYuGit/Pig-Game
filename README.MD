Game Rule 
-----------------------------------------
In the two-player game, player1 rolls a dice first, and every dice number will add to your current point. <br />
Players can choose to roll or hold; if the player decides to hold, all the current points will add to the scores and switch to another player.  <br />
If the player rolls a dice number 1, all the current points will disappear and switch to another player.  <br />
The first player which the sum of the current point and score equal to or more than 100 and then hits the hold button will be the winner player

I add my own rule on the Game 
----------------------------------------
When the player stack to current points equal to or more than 45 and then holds, the player will get the bonus of 5 points on scores.
However, that will be more chance to get dice number **1**

Have Fun!!
