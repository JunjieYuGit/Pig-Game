Game Rule 
-----------------------------------------
In the two-player game, player1 rolls a dice first, and every dice number will add to your current point. 
Players can choose to roll or hold; if the player decides to hold, all the current points will add to the scores and switch to another player. 
If the player rolls a dice number 1, all the current points will disappear and switch to another player. 
The first player which the sum of the current point and score equal to or more than 100 and then hits the hold button will be the winner player

Have Fun!!
